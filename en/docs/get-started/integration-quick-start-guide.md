# Quick Start Guide - Integration

Let's get started with WSO2 Micro Integrator by running a simple integration use case in your local environment. 

## Before you begin

1. Go to the [WSO2 Micro Integrator web page](https://wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator/#), click **Download**, and then click **Zip Archive** to download the Micro Integrator distribution as a ZIP file.
2. Go to the [API Manager Tooling web page](https://wso2.com/api-management/tooling/), and download WSO2 Integration Studio.

    !!! Info
        For more information, see the [installation instructions]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install-and-setup-overview/#installing_1).

2. Download the [sample files]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/tutorial/mi-qsg-home.zip). From this point onwards, let's refer to this folder as `<mi-qsg-home>`.
3. Download [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or a similar tool that can call an HTTP endpoint.

## What you'll build

This is a simple service orchestration scenario. The scenario is about a basic healthcare system where the Micro Integrator is used to integrate two back-end hospital services to provide information to the client.

Most healthcare centers have a system that is used to make doctor appointments. To check the availability of the doctors for a particular time, users typically need to visit the hospitals or use each and every online system that is dedicated to a particular healthcare center. Here, we are making it easier for patients by orchestrating those isolated systems for each healthcare provider and exposing a single interface to the users.

![Scenario]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/quick-start-guide/mi-quick-start-guide.png)

In the above scenario, the following takes place:

1. The client makes a call to the Healthcare API created using Micro Integrator.

2. The Healthcare API calls the Pine Valley Hospital back-end service and gets the queried information.

3. The Healthcare API calls the Grand Oak Hospital back-end service and gets the queried information.

4. The response is returned to the client with the required information.

Both Grand Oak Hospital and Pine Valley Hospital have services exposed over the HTTP protocol.

The Pine Valley Hospital service accepts a POST request in the following service endpoint URL.

```bash
http://<HOST_NAME>:<PORT>/pineValley/doctors
```

The Grand Oak Hospital service accepts a GET request in the following service endpoint URL.

```bash
http://<HOST_NAME>:<PORT>/grandOak/doctors/<DOCTOR_TYPE>
```

The expected payload should be in the following JSON format:

```bash
{
        "doctorType": "<DOCTOR_TYPE>"
}
```

Letâ€™s implement a simple integration solution that can be used to query the availability of doctors for a particular category from all the available healthcare centers.

## Step 1 - Set up the workspace

To set up the integration workspace for this quick start guide, we will use an integration project that was built using WSO2 Integration Studio:

Go to the `<mi-qsg-home>` directory. The following project files and executable back-end services are available.

- **HealthcareIntegrationProject/HealthcareIntegrationProjectConfigs**: This is the ESB Config module with the integration artifacts for the healthcare service. This service consists of the following REST API:

      <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/quick-start-guide/qsg-api.png">

      <details>
                <summary>HealthcareAPI.xml</summary>
            ```xml
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
            <api context="/healthcare" name="HealthcareAPI" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
                <resource methods="GET" uri-template="/doctor/{doctorType}">
                    <inSequence>
                        <clone>

                                        <args>
                                            <arg evaluator="xml" expression="$ctx:uri.var.doctorType"/>
                                        </args>
                                    </payloadFactory>
                                    <call>
                                        <endpoint key="PineValleyEndpoint"/>
                                    </call>
                                </sequence>
                            </target>
                        </clone>
                        <aggregate>
                            <completeCondition>
                                <messageCount max="-1" min="-1"/>
                            </completeCondition>
                            <onComplete aggregateElementType="root" expression="json-eval($.doctors.doctor)">
                                <respond/>

            </api>
            ```    
      </details>
      
      
      It also contains the following two files in the metadata folder.
      
      
    !!! Tip
        This data is used later in this guide by the API management runtime to generate the managed API proxy.

- **HealthcareIntegrationProject/HealthcareIntegrationProjectCompositeExporter**: This is the Composite Application Project folder, which contains the packaged CAR file of the healthcare service.

- **Backend**: This contains an executable .jar file that contains mock back-end service implementations for the Pine Valley Hospital and Grand Oak Hospital.

## Step 2 - Running the integration artifacts

Follow the steps given below to run the integration artifacts we developed on a Micro Integrator instance that is installed on a VM.

#### Start back-end services

Two mock hospital information services are available in the `DoctorInfo-JDK11.jar` file located in the `<mi-qsg-home>/Backend/` directory. 

Open a terminal window, navigate to the `<mi-qsg-home>/Backend/` folder and use the following command to start the services:

```bash
java -jar DoctorInfo-JDK11.jar
```

#### Deploy the healthcare service

Copy the CAR file of the healthcare service (HealthcareIntegrationProjectCompositeExporter_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.car) from the `<mi-qsg-home>/HealthcareIntegrationProject/HealthcareIntegrationProjectCompositeExporter/target/` directory to the `<MI_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/carbonapps` directory.

#### Start the Micro Integrator

Follow the steps relevant to your OS as shown below.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `<MI_HOME>/bin` folder.
2. Execute the relevant command:

    ```bash tab='On MacOS/Linux/CentOS'
    sh micro-integrator.sh
    ```

    ```bash tab='On Windows'
    micro-integrator.bat
    ```

#### (Optional) Start the Dashboard

If you want to view the integration artifacts deployed in the Micro Integrator, you can start the dashboard. The instructions on running the MI dashboard is given in the installation guide:

1.  [Install]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/installing-mi-dashboard) the MI dashboard.
2.  [Start]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/running-the-mi-dashboard) the MI dashboard.

#### Invoke the healthcare service

Open a terminal and execute the following curl command to invoke the service:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8290/healthcare/doctor/Ophthalmologist
```

Upon invocation, you should be able to observe the following response:

```bash
[ 
   [ 
      { 
         "name":"John Mathew",
         "time":"03:30 PM",
         "hospital":"Grand Oak"
      },
      { 
         "name":"Allan Silvester",
         "time":"04:30 PM",
         "hospital":"Grand Oak"
      }
   ],
   [ 
      { 
         "name":"John Mathew",
         "time":"07:30 AM",
         "hospital":"pineValley"
      },
      { 
         "name":"Roma Katherine",
         "time":"04:30 PM",
         "hospital":"pineValley"
      }
   ]
]
```

## Step 3 - Exposing an Integration Service as a Managed API

The REST API you deployed in the Micro Integrator is an **integration service** for the API Manager. Now, let's look at how you can expose the integration service to the API Management layer and generate a managed API by using the service.

First, let's start the API-M runtime:

1.  Go to the [WSO2 API Manager website](https://wso2.com/api-management/), click **TRY IT NOW**, and then click **Zip Archive** to download the API Manager distribution as a ZIP file.
2.  Extract the ZIP file.
3.  Start WSO2 API Manager:
    
    1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `<API-M_HOME>/bin` folder. 
    2.  Execute the relevant command:
        
        ```bash tab="On MacOS/Linux"
        ./api-manager.sh
        ```
        
        ```bash tab="On Windows"
        api-manager.bat
        ```

Update and start the Micro Integrator runtime:

1. Add the following configuration to the `<MI_HOME>/conf/deployment.toml` file of the Micro Integrator.

    !!! Tip
        The default username and password for connecting to the API gateway is `admin`.


    ```toml
    [[service_catalog]]
    apim_host = "https://localhost:9443"
    enable = true
    username = "admin"
    password = "admin"
    ```
    
2.  Restart the Micro Integrator.

    You will see the following in the server start-up log.

    ```bash
    Successfully updated the service catalog
    ```

Let's access the integration service from the **API Publisher**:

1. Sign in to the **API Publisher**: `https://localhost:9443/publisher`

    !!! Tip
        Use `admin` as the user name and password.

2. Click the **Hamburger Icon** in the upper-left of the **Publisher**.
3. Select the **Services** from the menu.
4. See that the `HealthcareAPI` is listed as a service.

You can now proceed to [create a managed API]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-an-api-using-a-service) using this service.
